#### Challenge
Digital Authentication & Access

#### Approach
Started as Design for the Real World, ended as Research Through Design

### How to run on emulator / device
- Clone the repository
- Open in Android Studio
#### Emulator
- If you don't have a device emulator, create one (I use Pixel XL API 29).
  - Target SDK version: 29
  - Minimum SDK version: 24
- Run 

#### Device
- Connect your device to your computer. Make sure it is both detected and selected by Android Studio.
- Run

### Running
Once the app has started you will have the choice to test different Morse code sequences. The difference between a long and short tap is in the milliseconds. Any touch that is >= 200 ms will be counted as a long touch, otherwise its a short touch.

The sequences are:
+ Test 1: .-..
+ Test 2: ..-.--
+ Test 3: --...--..
